GD/SVG version 0.01
===================

GD::SVG seamlessly enables the scalable vector graphics (SVG) output
from scripts written using GD.  It accomplishes this by translating GD
functions into SVG functions.

IMPORTANT NOTES

1. In addition to GD::SVG, Ronan Oger has created a similar module
(SVG::GD). In principle these modules perform a similar function but
go about it in slightly different ways.  Ronan and I are now
concurrently developing these modules which may be merged in the
future.

2. See the internal documentation on important notes on how to use
GD::SVG.

QUICKSTART USAGE GUIDE

To enable SVG output, you must change several elements of your
script. This includes the use statement and direct calls to the
classes that GD implements.

In short:
    
    # use GD;
    use GD::SVG;
  
    # my $image = GD::Image->new($width,$height);
    my $image = GD::SVG::Image->new($width,$height);
